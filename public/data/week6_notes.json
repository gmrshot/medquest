Inappropriate responses lead to immunopathology, which includes conditions like allergy and autoimmunity. A lack of immune response leads to immunodeficiency, with examples such as common variable immunodeficiency and HIV-1 disease. Autoimmunity occurs when the adaptive immune system directly responds to normal self-antigens, or when an appropriate response to an invading organism (like a pathogen) cross-reacts with self-antigens, a phenomenon known as molecular mimicry.",
          "explain_like_i_am_stupid": "Your immune system is primarily there to protect you from harm. But sometimes it makes mistakes: if it overreacts or attacks your own body, that's an \"inappropriate response\" leading to problems like allergies or autoimmune diseases. If it doesn't respond strongly enough, that's an \"immunodeficiency,\" making you vulnerable to infections. A special type of inappropriate response, autoimmunity, happens when your immune system mistakenly attacks your own body, either directly or by confusing parts of your body with similar-looking parts of a germ it's fighting.",

          "content": "The immune system functions as a \"sense organ\" designed to detect and respond to \"danger signals\". These danger signals originate from various sources. Traditionally, they were viewed as \"non-self\" substances foreign to the body, such as pathogenic bacteria or viruses. However, the body also needs to recognize and eliminate certain \"self\" cells, like cancer cells. Sometimes, the immune system can misidentify normal \"self\" cell proteins as danger signals, leading to an attack against its own tissues. Even microbubbles and cell fragments can activate the immune system as danger signals. The traditional paradigm of the immune system differentiating \"self\" from \"non-self\" is considered incomplete or wrong because it doesn't adequately explain immunosurveillance (e.g., tumor immunology), immunopathology (e.g., autoimmune disease), or the coexistence with the microbiome. Instead, the immune system focuses on identifying and getting rid of \"bad guys that shouldn\u2019t be there\". Immune tolerance describes situations where pathogens evade the immune system without alerting it, or when the immune system tolerates benign organisms that are part of the normal microbiome. Immune privilege refers to specific body parts (e.g., brain, parts of the eye, pregnant uterus, testicles) where immune inflammation and repair mechanisms could cause severe damage. Various suppressive mechanisms allow these areas to tolerate danger signals without initiating an immune response.",

External components include natural barriers like the skin and mucous membranes, which also contain associated lymphoid tissues: skin-associated lymphoid tissue (SALT), mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), and bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT). Internal components include the innate immune system, the adaptive immune system, and various organs. These organs are categorized as primary lymphoid organs where lymphocytes originate and develop (bone marrow for all lymphocytes and B cell development, thymus for T cell development) and secondary lymphoid organs where immune responses are initiated (lymph nodes, spleen, mucosal-associated lymphatics like tonsils and Peyer's patches, and lymphatic vessels). A clinical correlation is DiGeorge Syndrome, where absence of the thymus due to a deletion on chromosome 22 (22q11.2) leads to a lack of T cell immunity, necessitating a thymus transplant.",

          "content": "The innate and adaptive immune systems usually cooperate, though sometimes one may be more prominent. Innate Immune System: Components: Includes cells (neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) including natural killer (NK) cells), specialized receptors (pattern-recognition receptors or PRRs), signaling molecules (cytokines), and the complement system. Pattern-Recognition Receptors (PRRs): These are the fundamental receptors for innate responses, encoded in germline DNA (inherited). They non-specifically recognize conserved molecular patterns called PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) or DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns). These patterns are shared by many foreign substances but are not normally present in humans. Features: Responses are preprogrammed and stereotyped, acting very quickly (seconds to hours). It lacks immunological \"memory,\" meaning the same response occurs with each exposure. Mechanisms: Phagocytosis (eating invaders), inflammation (characterized by rubor, tumor, calor, dolor, functio laesa), and cytotoxicity (direct killing of cells). Adaptive Immune System: Components: Includes cells (T cells, B cells, plasma cells), receptors formed by the rearrangement of germline DNA to create antigen-binding molecules highly specific for individual danger signals (antigens), cytokines from both innate and adaptive cells, and antibodies produced following B cell activation. Features: On initial exposure (primary immune response), these responses take days to weeks to develop. However, upon subsequent exposure (secondary immune response), immunological memory allows for a rapid response within seconds. Mechanisms: Humoral immunity involves antibodies and B cells with T cell help. Cell-mediated immunity involves cytotoxic T cells. A clinical correlation is Reticular Dysgenesis, a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) that impacts both the innate (agranulocytosis) and adaptive (lymphopenia) immune systems, also causing sensorineural deafness. It is autosomal recessive and treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).",

The Innate immune system is like your rapid-response police: they're always on duty, act super fast, use general tools to spot common bad guys (PAMPs), and respond the same way every time without remembering past encounters.

          "content": "As an immune response subsides, several processes occur to resolve inflammation and repair tissues. Acute infections: Neutrophils die and accumulate with dead tissue and pathogens, forming pus. Chronic localized infections: The immune system can wall off the infection, creating a physical barrier and forming an abscess. Disseminated or systemic infections: If no localized barrier can be formed, the immune system fights a widespread battle, potentially leading to sepsis. For the resolution of an immune response: Pro-inflammatory responses decrease: Cytokine production drops, and the chemotaxis of immune cells slows down. Tissue repair and healing begin: Macrophages play a crucial role by eating dead pathogens and tissues. They also signal local cells to initiate repair and recruit specialized wound-healing cells to the damaged area. Lymphocyte fate: Activating signals for B cells diminish, causing most plasma cells to die by apoptosis. However, some plasma cells migrate to the lymphatic system where they receive signals to survive for long periods, becoming memory cells ready for future exposures to the same organism. Pro-inflammatory T-helper cells undergo apoptosis, while anti-inflammatory T-helper cells become more active. Cytotoxic T cells also downregulate their activity.",
          "explain_like_i_am_stupid": "Once the battle against an infection is over, your body begins a cleanup and repair phase. The \"fire\" of inflammation dies down as fewer inflammatory signals are produced. Cleanup crews (macrophages) eat up all the dead cells and leftover debris.

Their role is to eradicate infected or cancerous cells. Virus-infected cells typically express less MHC Class I on their surface, which can trigger NK cell activation. In the innate system, NK cells are activated by cytokines like Type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) and IL-12, secreted by infected cells. Once activated by IL-12, NK cells produce additional cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1. NK cells destroy target cells either indirectly through cytokine production (e.g., IFN-\u03b3) or directly by releasing cytolytic granules (containing perforin and granzymes) or inducing apoptosis via Fas-FasL interaction. Macrophages: Known as \"big eaters,\" they are indiscriminate phagocytes involved in both direct and indirect killing. Macrophage activation depends on cytokines like TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3. There are two types: M1 macrophages primarily promote pro-inflammatory responses, combating pathogens and signaling other immune cells. M2 macrophages are associated with anti-inflammatory actions, tissue repair, and wound healing. Macrophages also act as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the adaptive immune system. Neutrophils: These constantly circulate in the blood and enter tissues (extravasation) when needed to eradicate pathogens. Extravasation involves interactions with vascular epithelial cells via selectins, integrins, and adhesion receptors. Neutrophils ingest pathogens through phagocytosis and then kill them.

Pro-inflammatory cytokines (examples with overlap): Trigger cell death: Interleukin-1-beta (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1). Endogenous pyrogens (cause fever): IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1. Vasodilation: IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1. NK cell (and ILC1 cell) activation: IL-12, leading to IFN-\u03b3 production. Facilitate chemotaxis: CXCL8 (a chemokine). Clinical Correlation: TNF-\u03b1 is a significant therapeutic target in many chronic inflammatory diseases; for example, Etanercept acts as a decoy receptor to prevent TNF-\u03b1 from binding its normal receptor. Interferons: A group of specialized cytokines with about two dozen types, divided into Type I, Type II, and Type III. General Features: Antiviral properties, immune system activation and regulation, and interaction with NK cells. Type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2): Respond intracellularly to viral infection, interfering with viral replication and signaling nearby cells. Type II interferons (IFN-\u03b3): Activate macrophages and have other roles in adaptive immunity. Anti-inflammatory cytokines: IL-10: Produced by macrophages, dendritic cells, and certain adaptive immune cells. It inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12), inhibits innate immune cell activation, and some adaptive immune responses. Transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2): Also an important anti-inflammatory cytokine. Clinical Correlation (SARS-CoV-2): Viral RNA (a PAMP) activates various PRRs (TLRs, RLRs, NLRP3). Innate responses involve Type I interferons and other cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-6, IL-18) and ILCs (including NK cells), leading to antiviral programs and stimulating adaptive responses.

          "content": "The complement system is comprised of over 30 soluble plasma proteins produced in the liver. It is officially part of the innate immune system but also functions in adaptive immunity. It's a cascading system, similar to coagulation. Complement Functions: Lysis: Punching holes in cell membranes. The terminal complement pathway (C5b, C6, C7, C8, C9) forms the membrane attack complex (MAC). Critical for defense against Neisseria gonorrheae and Neisseria meningitidis. Human cells are protected from complement-mediated lysis by mechanisms involving soluble regulatory proteins (S protein, clusterin, factor J) and membrane-bound proteins (Homologous Restriction Factor/HRF/CD59 and Protectin/CD59, Decay Accelerating Factor/DAF/CD55). These protective proteins are anchored to the cell membrane by GPI anchors, which are made with the help of the PIGA gene. Clinical Correlation: Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH): Caused by somatic PIGA gene variants (germline variants are lethal). This leads to a lack of CD59 and CD55 on RBCs, causing unregulated terminal complement activation and complement-mediated RBC lysis. Manifestations include hemoglobinuria, anemia, and thrombosis. Eculizumab, a therapeutic monoclonal antibody that binds C5, prevents its cleavage and inhibits the terminal complement pathway, is used to treat PNH. Opsonization: Coating invading organisms to make them more \"attractive\" for phagocytosis. C3b, IgM, and IgG can bind to cell surfaces. Macrophages have receptors (CR1 for C3b, CR3/CR4 for iC3b) that recognize these tags, facilitating engulfment. Binding: To receptors on leukocytes and other cells, enhancing immune responses. Chemotaxis: Attracting inflammatory cells to infection sites. Activation: Activating mast cells, basophils, and other cells. Scavenging: Removing dead cells and tagging circulating immune complexes for removal. Activation Pathways (all converge on C3): C3: A pivotal, abundant, inactive protease in serum. When activated, it splits into C3a and C3b. Some C3b directly lands on pathogens, or C3 undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis to initiate the alternative pathway. Alternative Pathway: Can be initiated by spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 or directly on pathogen surfaces. Lectin Pathway: Initiated by acute phase reactants like mannose-binding lectin (MBL), whose production is induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1). MBL binds to mannose-containing carbohydrates on pathogen surfaces, leading to classical C3 convertase production. Classical Pathway: Initiated by C-reactive protein (CRP) or antibody binding to a pathogen, which then serves as a platform for C1 binding. This leads to the production of C4b and C2a, forming the classical C3 convertase (C4b2a). Regulation of Complement: C1 Inhibitor (C1INH): Also called C1 esterase inhibitor, it regulates C1 activation and functions in coagulation and kinin pathways. It binds to activated C1r and C1s, causing them to dissociate from C1q. Clinical Correlation: Hereditary Angioedema (HAE): Caused by C1INH deficiency (heterozygotes have about half-normal levels; homozygous is lethal). This results in excessive C4 and C2 consumption and abundant bradykinin production, leading to episodes of painless swelling. Type 1 HAE: Quantitative C1INH deficiency. Type 2 HAE: Functional C1INH deficiency. HAE with normal C1INH (formerly Type 3): Normal C1INH levels and function; some female patients have a Factor XII gain-of-function variant, often estrogen-dependent. Acquired Angioedema: Not hereditary. Caused by autoantibody to C1INH or excessive C1 activation in autoimmune diseases/cancer depleting C1INH. Elevated C1q suggests acquired angioedema.",

This army can be activated in a few ways, but all paths lead to a central protein called C3. Your own cells have protective shields to stop the complement army from attacking them.

There are 10 functional TLR genes (TLR1-TLR10) in humans, plus a pseudogene for TLR11. When activated, TLRs signal macrophages and other cells to produce cytokines that interact with other immune cells. TLRs are found on most nucleated cells. External TLRs sense bacterial PAMPs: TLR2 and TLR4: Recognize bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). TLR4 also recognizes LPS. TLR1/TLR2, TLR2/TLR6, TLR5, TLR10 are also external TLRs. Clinical Correlation (TLR4): The TLR4 gene variant Asp299Gly (D299G), prevalent in 6-10% of the population, is associated with increased susceptibility to gram-negative bacteremia/sepsis, RSV infection, tonsillitis, HIV-associated TB, Boutonneuse fever, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn\u2019s, ulcerative colitis), and certain cancers. Internal (Endosomal) TLRs sense viral PAMPs: TLR3: Recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), found in some viruses (e.g., Herpes simplex). Clinical Correlation (TLR3 and HSV-1): UNC-93B is an endoplasmic reticulum protein essential for normal TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9 signaling and host response to Herpes simplex virus (HSV). A gene variant in UNC-93B causes susceptibility to Herpes simplex viral encephalitis. TLR3 is also implicated in severe COVID-19. TLR7 and TLR8: Recognize single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), found in many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Clinical Correlation (COVID-19): TLR7 variants are associated with severe COVID-19 in young persons. Clinical Correlation (Pharmacology Factoid - Inquimod): Inquimod is a TLR7/8 agonist used clinically for anti-viral and anti-tumor therapy. TLR9: Recognizes unmethylated CpG DNA, found in many bacterial and viral genomes. TLR Signaling: The TLR signaling cascade has increasing clinical relevance. TLR4 Signaling Example: Bacterial LPS binds TLR4, MD2, and CD14. MyD88 then binds the TIR domain of TLR4, and IRAK4 binds MyD88. This initiates a kinase cascade activating TRAF6 and inhibitor of kappa-B kinase (IKK). Most TLRs and the IL-1 receptor use this pathway. Clinical Correlation (MyD88/IRAK4 Deficiency): Deficiency of IRAK4 or MyD88 causes human immunodeficiency, with common infections including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Gram-negative organisms. Those who survive usually don't have infections after age 14. IKK: A complex of three molecules: IKK-alpha, IKK-beta, and IKK-gamma (also known as NEMO). Clinical Correlation (NEMO gene variants): Cause incontinentia pigmenti, anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, impaired antibody class switching (hyper-IgM phenotype), and recurrent infections.

NLRP3 is a key NLR involved in inflammasome activation. NLRP3 and the Inflammasome: Macrophage activation induces the production of IL-1\u03b2 from its precursor, pro-IL-1\u03b2. IL-1\u03b2 is a potent pro-inflammatory molecule, so its production must be tightly regulated. Caspase 1 is the enzyme that converts pro-IL-1\u03b2 into active IL-1\u03b2. Its production from procaspase 1 increases upon macrophage activation, facilitated by the NLR cryopyrin, encoded by the NLRP3 gene. Cryopyrin forms an inflammasome complex that binds procaspase 1. This leads to the proteolysis of procaspase 1 into active caspase 1, which then generates IL-1\u03b2. Activated inflammasomes can trigger pyroptosis (inflammatory cell death), which can contribute to cytokine storm and septic shock. Clinical Correlation (COVID-19): Severe COVID-19 involves a systemic inflammatory response causing ARDS, partly due to dysregulated, intense NLRP3 activation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2. Autoinflammatory Diseases: These diseases are mediated by the innate immune system, with IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-18, and TNF being major contributors. In contrast, autoimmune diseases are mediated by the adaptive immune system, driven by the IL-17 family and IFN-\u03b3.

There are 10 functional TLR genes (TLR1-TLR10) in humans, plus a pseudogene for TLR11. When activated, TLRs signal macrophages and other cells to produce cytokines that interact with other immune cells. TLRs are found on most nucleated cells. External TLRs sense bacterial PAMPs: TLR2 and TLR4: Recognize bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). TLR4 also recognizes LPS. TLR1/TLR2, TLR2/TLR6, TLR5, TLR10 are also external TLRs. Clinical Correlation (TLR4): The TLR4 gene variant Asp299Gly (D299G), prevalent in 6-10% of the population, is associated with increased susceptibility to gram-negative bacteremia/sepsis, RSV infection, tonsillitis, HIV-associated TB, Boutonneuse fever, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn\u2019s, ulcerative colitis), and certain cancers. Internal (Endosomal) TLRs sense viral PAMPs: TLR3: Recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), found in some viruses (e.g., Herpes simplex). Clinical Correlation (TLR3 and HSV-1): UNC-93B is an endoplasmic reticulum protein essential for normal TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9 signaling and host response to Herpes simplex virus (HSV). A gene variant in UNC-93B causes susceptibility to Herpes simplex viral encephalitis. TLR3 is also implicated in severe COVID-19. TLR7 and TLR8: Recognize single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), found in many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Clinical Correlation (COVID-19): TLR7 variants are associated with severe COVID-19 in young persons. Clinical Correlation (Pharmacology Factoid - Inquimod): Inquimod is a TLR7/8 agonist used clinically for anti-viral and anti-tumor therapy. TLR9: Recognizes unmethylated CpG DNA, found in many bacterial and viral genomes. TLR Signaling: The TLR signaling cascade has increasing clinical relevance. TLR4 Signaling Example: Bacterial LPS binds TLR4, MD2, and CD14. MyD88 then binds the TIR domain of TLR4, and IRAK4 binds MyD88. This initiates a kinase cascade activating TRAF6 and inhibitor of kappa-B kinase (IKK). Most TLRs and the IL-1 receptor use this pathway. Clinical Correlation (MyD88/IRAK4 Deficiency): Deficiency of IRAK4 or MyD88 causes human immunodeficiency, with common infections including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Gram-negative organisms. Those who survive usually don't have infections after age 14. IKK: A complex of three molecules: IKK-alpha, IKK-beta, and IKK-gamma (also known as NEMO). Clinical Correlation (NEMO gene variants): Cause incontinentia pigmenti, anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, impaired antibody class switching (hyper-IgM phenotype), and recurrent infections.

NLRP3 is a key NLR involved in inflammasome activation. NLRP3 and the Inflammasome: Macrophage activation induces the production of IL-1\u03b2 from its precursor, pro-IL-1\u03b2. IL-1\u03b2 is a potent pro-inflammatory molecule, so its production must be tightly regulated. Caspase 1 is the enzyme that converts pro-IL-1\u03b2 into active IL-1\u03b2. Its production from procaspase 1 increases upon macrophage activation, facilitated by the NLR cryopyrin, encoded by the NLRP3 gene. Cryopyrin forms an inflammasome complex that binds procaspase 1. This leads to the proteolysis of procaspase 1 into active caspase 1, which then generates IL-1\u03b2. Activated inflammasomes can trigger pyroptosis (inflammatory cell death), which can contribute to cytokine storm and septic shock. Clinical Correlation (COVID-19): Severe COVID-19 involves a systemic inflammatory response causing ARDS, partly due to dysregulated, intense NLRP3 activation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2. Autoinflammatory Diseases: These diseases are mediated by the innate immune system, with IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-18, and TNF being major contributors.

Once mature, a B cell proudly displays two types of receptors: IgM and IgD. Only later, during an actual immune response, can it \"switch\" to making other types of antibodies like IgG or IgE.",

T cell receptors are formed through a gene rearrangement process similar to that used by B cells, and T cell development also involves checkpoints. A key difference from B cells is that T cells need to recognize certain self-antigens with some, but not too much, strength. Stages of T cell development in the thymus: Pro-T cells: Lack both CD4 and CD8 surface markers, thus called \"double-negative\". Immature T cells: Express both CD4 and CD8 on their surface, making them \"double-positive\". Mature T cells: As they mature, T cells lose either CD4 or CD8, becoming single-positive. The thymus contains a \"library\" of self-antigens (MHC+peptide complexes) used to test developing T cells. Negative selection: Eliminates T cells that either don't recognize self-MHC at all or those that recognize self-MHC too strongly. Positive selection: Occurs when a T cell receptor weakly recognizes Class I MHC + self-peptide (leading to the cell losing CD4 and becoming a CD8+ T cell), or weakly recognizes Class II MHC + self-peptide (leading to the cell losing CD8 and becoming a CD4+ T cell). Some also become regulatory T cells. Clinical Correlation (DiGeorge Syndrome): This syndrome is caused by a defect in embryogenesis, leading to the absence of the thymus, parathyroid glands, heart defects, and other midline abnormalities. Patients with \"complete\" DiGeorge syndrome will present with hypocalcemia (due to absent parathyroids) and a complete lack of functional T cells because their T cell precursors have no thymus for maturation. It's associated with a deletion on chromosome 22 (22q11.2) and is summarized by the mnemonic CATCH-22: Cardiac defects, Abnormal facies, Thymic hypoplasia, Cleft palate, Hypocalcemia \u2013 on chromosome 22q11.2. Clinical Correlation (APS-1 / APECED): The AIRE gene oversees the thymic self MHC-peptide library, presenting a wide array of self-antigens for T cell selection. An AIRE gene variant causes Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy Syndrome, Type 1 (APS-1), also known as APECED (Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy Candidiasis Ectodermal Dystrophy).

Depending on which type of ID badge they see, they decide to become either a CD4 helper T cell or a CD8 killer T cell. Negative Selection: Any T cells that strongly recognize your body's \"ID badges\" (self-antigens) are eliminated to prevent them from attacking your own tissues. If the thymus is missing (like in DiGeorge Syndrome), T cells can't complete their training, leading to a severe lack of T cell immunity.

IgG and IgA further have subclasses: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4; and IgA1, IgA2. This is the only nomenclature for human antibody classes and subclasses. Each antibody molecule consists of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains, held together by strategically placed disulfide bonds. Heavy and light chains are encoded by genes on different chromosomes. The C terminus side has a constant region with a defined amino acid sequence that is largely the same for a given heavy or light chain class/subclass. Antigen (Ag) binding occurs at the N terminus side, which is highly variable to recognize diverse antigens, hence called the variable region. For a heavy chain, this is VH; for a light chain, it's VL. Heavy and light chains have protein \"domains\". Heavy chains have one variable domain (VH) and 3 or 4 constant domains (CH1, CH2, CH3, and sometimes CH4), depending on the isotype. Gamma (\u03b3), delta (\u03b4), and alpha (\u03b1) heavy chains have 4 domains. Mu (\u03bc) and epsilon (\u03b5) heavy chains have 5 domains. Light chains have only two domains: a variable domain (VL) at the N terminus and a constant domain (CL) at the C terminus.

Light chain V region (B cell) and \u03b1 chain V region (T cell): Genes have many V (variable) segments and a few J (joining) segments. One J segment randomly joins one V segment, forming VJ. Heavy chain V region (B cell) and \u03b2 chain V region (T cell): This involves an extra step. One D (diversity) segment first joins one J segment (forming DJ), and then DJ connects to one V segment, forming VDJ. Junctional Diversity: The DNA cutting, pasting, and repairing process is slightly \"sloppy,\" introducing \"junctional P and N nucleotides\" that significantly increase receptor diversity. RAG-1 and RAG-2 complexes: These oversee the V(D)J recombination process. Errors in pasting can cause cancer, highlighting the need for checkpoints. BRECs and TRECs: Unused, excised DNA forms loops called B cell receptor excision circles (BRECs) and T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) during B and T cell development. Clinical Correlation (TREC Counting): Counting TRECs is part of newborn screening in all 50 US states. A low TREC count indicates problems with T cell development, a serious cause being severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Clinical Correlation (RAG-1 or RAG-2 deficiency): Gene variants causing loss of function in either RAG-1 or RAG-2 can lead to one form of SCID. Partial loss of function results in Omenn syndrome, sometimes called 'leaky SCID'. NK cells, lacking immune receptors, are unaffected. Clinical Correlation (Burkitt\u2019s Lymphoma): Errors in DNA cutting and pasting can cause translocation of the MYC gene (chromosome 8) to the immunoglobulin heavy chain region (chromosome 14) or light chain chromosomes, leading to unregulated MYC expression and unchecked B cell growth (cancer). B Cell Receptor Class Switching (Immunoglobulin Class Switching): Initial Production: After VDJ recombination, a heavy chain gene is ready. VDJ is transcribed along with genetic material for both mu (\u03bc) and delta (\u03b4) heavy chains. The transcript is edited so that both IgM and IgD are produced as receptors on the surface of a mature B cell. In a primary immune response, IgM is the first circulating antibody class produced by plasma cells. Switching: Different antibody classes have different functions. Under the direction of specific cytokines from the environment, the B cell may need to make one of the 4 IgG subclasses, 2 IgA subclasses, or IgE as its receptor. This involves the B cell associating VDJ with a different heavy chain gene \u2013 a process called class switching. DNA between VDJ and the new heavy chain gene gets looped out and is permanently lost. DNA distal to the switch remains available for further switching. Heavy Chain Sequence (Andy Thornton Method / Wayne Causey Method): IgM, IgD, IgG3, IgG1, IgA1, IgG2, IgG4, IgE, IgA2.

They can be proteins, glycoproteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, or even small organic molecules (haptens) that bind to a carrier protein to become immunogenic. The small part of an intact antigen recognized by the immune system is called an epitope. Some antigens are univalent (one epitope), while others are polyvalent (many different epitopes). An epitope in a protein might be only a few amino acids long. Some epitopes bind to B cell receptors (leading to antibody response), while others bind to T cell receptors (producing a T cell response). A large antigen typically has both B cell epitopes and different T cell epitopes. Epitopes can be linear (amino acids in a row) or conformational (amino acids brought together by 3D folding). Antigens and CDRs: B cell receptors can recognize parts (epitopes) of large, intact protein or carbohydrate antigens. T cell receptors require other cells (APCs) to break down (process) proteins. They recognize short amino acid sequences presented along with specialized MHC molecules that carry the processed peptide to the T cell receptor. Antigen-Antibody (Ag-Ab) Binding: Binding is noncovalent, primarily driven by electrostatic interactions (\"salt bridges\") and hydrogen bonds, with Van der Waals and hydrophobic forces being less important. The binding site's shape (conformation) is not a strict \"lock and key\" but forms an \"atomic cloud\" that can adapt to bind an epitope with sufficient affinity (sum of all attractive and repulsive forces) to elicit an immune response.

Neutralization: This involves blocking the entry and binding of pathogens or neutralizing toxins. Pathogen Neutralization: Some viruses and bacteria bind to target cells via specific receptors. Pre-formed antibodies can block this binding, preventing infection. IgG is effective in body tissues, while IgA is crucial on mucosal surfaces. Toxin Neutralization: Bacterial and other toxins bind to target cell receptors, causing damage. High-affinity antibodies can bind to toxins, preventing their attachment to target cells. Again, IgG works in body tissues, and IgA on mucosal surfaces. Best Classes: IgG and IgA are best at neutralization. Opsonization: Simple antibody binding to pathogens or toxins doesn't eliminate them. Instead, antibodies \"tag\" them, identifying them for destruction by other immune cells. Neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages have Fc receptors that bind to the Fc portion of antibodies, allowing them to engulf and destroy the tagged targets through phagocytosis. These Fc receptors are antibody class-specific and named for the heavy chain they recognize (e.g., Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RII for IgG). Best Class: IgG (especially IgG1 and IgG3) is best for opsonization. ADCC (Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity): Natural killer (NK) cells, which function in both innate and adaptive immune systems, have Fc receptors (Fc\u03b3RIII; CD16) that recognize antibodies coating an invader (opsonization). Crosslinking of these NK cell Fc receptors activates the NK cell, leading to the target cell's death via apoptosis. Best Classes: IgG1, IgG3 are best for ADCC. Complement Activation: The complement system performs many functions, including opsonization, promoting inflammation, phagocytosis, and scavenging unwanted circulating immune complexes. Clinical Correlation (Immune Complexes and SLE): In Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), massive immune complex formation is a major cause of renal failure. Deficiencies in early complement components can lead to lupus-like diseases because immune complexes cannot be properly tagged with C4b or C3b for clearance. Best Classes: IgM and IgG (but not IgG4) are best for complement activation. IgE and Mast Cells: Mast cells, basophils, and activated eosinophils express Fc\u03b5RI, a high-affinity IgE receptor. When crosslinked by antigen (allergen), this receptor causes mast cell activation. Activated mast cells release histamine, leukotrienes, cytokines, and other mediators, which produce immediate allergic symptoms, recruit eosinophils, and amplify IgE responses. Mast cell mediators are also important in defense against certain parasites. Clinical Correlation (Tryptase): Elevated serum tryptase levels are a biomarker for mast cell activation (e.g., anaphylaxis, mastocytosis). BTK is an important signaling molecule in mast cell activation, and BTK inhibitors are in trials for conditions like non-allergic urticaria and mastocytosis.

Isotypes: There are 6 isotypes, HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-E, HLA-F, and HLA-G. HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C are the most polymorphic and clinically significant. Expression: Expressed on all nucleated cells because all nucleated cells can be infected by intracellular organisms like viruses [20, and HLA-DR** are the most polymorphic and clinically significant. Expression: Expressed primarily on professional APCs (macrophages, dendritic cells, B cells). Function: Present peptides derived from extracellular (exogenous) antigens to CD4+ T cells.

These genes are closely linked and tend to be inherited as a unit called a haplotype. MHC genes are codominant, meaning if an individual is heterozygous for an isotype, both alleles will be expressed. Nomenclature: Modern HLA typing uses molecular sequencing, but clinicians also use simpler serologic \"family\" names (e.g., HLA-B27, HLA-DQ5) and more precise variants (e.g., HLA-B*2701).
