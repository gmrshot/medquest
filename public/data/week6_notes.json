They also signal local cells to initiate repair and recruit specialized wound-healing cells to the damaged area.\nLymphocyte fate: Activating signals for B cells diminish, causing most plasma cells to die by apoptosis. However, some plasma cells migrate to the lymphatic system where they receive signals to survive for long periods, becoming memory cells ready for future exposures to the same organism. Pro-inflammatory T-helper cells undergo apoptosis, while anti-inflammatory T-helper cells become more active. Cytotoxic T cells also downregulate their activity.\nEasy to understand explanation Once the battle against an infection is over, your body begins a cleanup and repair phase. The \"fire\" of inflammation dies down as fewer inflammatory signals are produced. Cleanup crews (macrophages) eat up all the dead cells and leftover debris. Most of the fighting cells (like plasma cells and many T-helper cells) die off, but a select few (memory cells) are kept alive, ready to quickly respond if the same enemy ever returns.\nMnemonic \"CALM\": Cytokines drop, Apoptosis (most cells die), Lymphatics (memory cells go there), Macrophages clean up.\nBasics of Innate Immunity I_2025.pdf",

This recognition induces macrophages and other cells to produce IL-12.\nClinical Correlation: An IL-12 subunit gene variant increases susceptibility to BCG, TB, non-TB mycobacteria, and Salmonella species.\nIFN-gamma production: IL-12 then binds to an IL-12 receptor on T cells and NK cells, inducing them to produce IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha.\nClinical Correlation: An IL-12 receptor gene variant also causes similar infections.\nMacrophage Activation: IFN-gamma has two receptors, and its binding activates macrophages.\nClinical Correlation: An IFN-gamma receptor gene variant leads to similar infections.\nSignal Transduction: The signal from an activated IFN-gamma receptor is transduced to the nucleus via a JAK-STAT pathway. Gene variants in JAK or STAT components can also disrupt this pathway.\nClinical Syndrome: Defects in any component of the IL-12, IFN-gamma pathway cause \"Mendelian Susceptibility to Mycobacterial Disease\" (MSMD). Patients with MSMD develop infections with normally weakly-virulent mycobacteria, BCGosis, Salmonella, and sometimes TB.\nEasy to understand explanation This pathway is like an internal alarm system specifically for certain tough bacteria like mycobacteria. When TLR-2 detects these invaders, it triggers the release of IL-12. IL-12 then tells T cells and NK cells to produce a strong signal called IFN-gamma. IFN-gamma, in turn, super-activates macrophages to fight off the infection. Any breaks in this chain \u2013 from the IL-12 signal itself, to its receptor, to the IFN-gamma signal, or its receptor, or even the internal wiring (JAK-STAT) \u2013 can lead to severe susceptibility to these specific infections, known as MSMD.\nMnemonic \"TLR-2 to MSMD: I.I.N.S.\" (IL-12, IFN-\u03b3, NK cells/T cells, STAT/JAK) \"MSMD: My Stupid Macrophages Don't Respond!\" (MSMD occurs because macrophages can't get activated properly by IFN-\u03b3 due to pathway defects).\nOverview of the Adaptive Immune System_2025.pdf",

Some also become regulatory T cells.\nClinical Correlation (DiGeorge Syndrome): This syndrome is caused by a defect in embryogenesis, leading to the absence of the thymus, parathyroid glands, heart defects, and other midline abnormalities. Patients with \"complete\" DiGeorge syndrome will present with hypocalcemia (due to absent parathyroids) and a complete lack of functional T cells because their T cell precursors have no thymus for maturation.

An AIRE gene variant causes Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy Syndrome, Type 1 (APS-1), also known as APECED (Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy Candidiasis Ectodermal Dystrophy). Patients develop various autoimmune diseases, often affecting the endocrine system (e.g., Addison disease), and chronic candidiasis, with Th17 cytokines being involved.\nEasy to understand explanation T cells start in the bone marrow but move to the thymus for specialized \"schooling.\" Here, they build their unique receptors and undergo strict training. This training has two main parts:\nPositive Selection: T cells must learn to recognize your body's \"ID badges\" (MHC molecules) just a little bit to prove they can see them. Depending on which type of ID badge they see, they decide to become either a CD4 helper T cell or a CD8 killer T cell.\nNegative Selection: Any T cells that strongly recognize your body's \"ID badges\" (self-antigens) are eliminated to prevent them from attacking your own tissues. If the thymus is missing (like in DiGeorge Syndrome), T cells can't complete their training, leading to a severe lack of T cell immunity. If the \"library\" of self-antigens in the thymus is faulty (due to an AIRE gene defect, as in APECED), T cells don't learn what \"self\" is, and they go out and cause autoimmune diseases.\nMnemonic \"T.T.T.

The transcript is edited so that both IgM and IgD are produced as receptors on the surface of a mature B cell. In a primary immune response, IgM is the first circulating antibody class produced by plasma cells.\nSwitching: Different antibody classes have different functions. Under the direction of specific cytokines from the environment, the B cell may need to make one of the 4 IgG subclasses, 2 IgA subclasses, or IgE as its receptor. This involves the B cell associating VDJ with a different heavy chain gene \u2013 a process called class switching. DNA between VDJ and the new heavy chain gene gets looped out and is permanently lost. DNA distal to the switch remains available for further switching.\nHeavy Chain Sequence (Andy Thornton Method / Wayne Causey Method): IgM, IgD, IgG3, IgG1, IgA1, IgG2, IgG4, IgE, IgA2.

To make their unique receptors, they cut and paste these segments together in a random fashion (V(D)J recombination). This process, supervised by \"editor\" proteins like RAG-1 and RAG-2, also adds \"junk\" letters (P and N nucleotides) to increase diversity, ensuring each B or T cell has a slightly different receptor. After a B cell makes its receptor, it first produces IgM and IgD antibodies. But if the immune response needs a different \"tool\" (like IgG for long-term protection or IgE for allergies), the B cell can \"class switch.\" This means it cuts out and permanently discards the genes for IgM/IgD and replaces them with genes for the new antibody type, guided by chemical signals from other immune cells.\nMnemonic \"V.D.J.

For example, the HLA-B27 \"family\" has over 170 known alleles.\nEasy to understand explanation MHC molecules are unique \"ID badge\" holders found on your cells, determined by genes on chromosome 6.

Matching for Class II (HLA-DP, -DQ, -DR) is also beneficial.\nPaternity testing: HLA haplotypes are inherited as a unit, making them useful for establishing biological relationships.\nForensic analysis: While DNA analysis is now more common, HLA typing can be used in forensic investigations.\nDisease associations: Certain diseases are strongly associated with specific HLA alleles. A classic example is the association of HLA-B27 (and some of its forms) with certain types of arthritis.\nPredicting adverse drug reactions: HLA typing can identify individuals at higher risk for severe drug reactions.\nClinical Correlation (Abacavir): The HIV drug abacavir can cause severe Type IV hypersensitivity reactions.

Autoimmunity occurs when the adaptive immune system directly responds to normal self-antigens, or when an appropriate response to an invading organism (like a pathogen) cross-reacts with self-antigens, a phenomenon known as molecular mimicry.\nEasy to understand explanation Your immune system is primarily there to protect you from harm.

These danger signals originate from various sources. Traditionally, they were viewed as \"non-self\" substances foreign to the body, such as pathogenic bacteria or viruses. However, the body also needs to recognize and eliminate certain \"self\" cells, like cancer cells. Sometimes, the immune system can misidentify normal \"self\" cell proteins as danger signals, leading to an attack against its own tissues. Even microbubbles and cell fragments can activate the immune system as danger signals.\nThe traditional paradigm of the immune system differentiating \"self\" from \"non-self\" is considered incomplete or wrong because it doesn't adequately explain immunosurveillance (e.g., tumor immunology), immunopathology (e.g., autoimmune disease), or the coexistence with the microbiome. Instead, the immune system focuses on identifying and getting rid of \"bad guys that shouldn\u2019t be there\".\nImmune tolerance describes situations where pathogens evade the immune system without alerting it, or when the immune system tolerates benign organisms that are part of the normal microbiome. Immune privilege refers to specific body parts (e.g., brain, parts of the eye, pregnant uterus, testicles) where immune inflammation and repair mechanisms could cause severe damage. Various suppressive mechanisms allow these areas to tolerate danger signals without initiating an immune response.\nEasy to understand explanation Your immune system is like a vigilant detective, constantly scanning for \"danger signals.\" These signals aren't just from outside invaders like germs; they can also come from internal threats like cancer cells, or even from your own body if the detective gets confused and thinks a normal part is dangerous.

These organs are categorized as primary lymphoid organs where lymphocytes originate and develop (bone marrow for all lymphocytes and B cell development, thymus for T cell development) and secondary lymphoid organs where immune responses are initiated (lymph nodes, spleen, mucosal-associated lymphatics like tonsils and Peyer's patches, and lymphatic vessels). A clinical correlation is DiGeorge Syndrome, where absence of the thymus due to a deletion on chromosome 22 (22q11.2) leads to a lack of T cell immunity, necessitating a thymus transplant.\nEasy to understand explanation Imagine your body's defense system is a castle. The outer walls, gates, and border patrols (like skin and mucous membranes with their local immune outposts such as SALT and MALT) are your external components. Inside the castle, you have two main armies: the Innate army (your quick, general responders) and the Adaptive army (your specialized, memory-keeping forces).

However, upon subsequent exposure (secondary immune response), immunological memory allows for a rapid response within seconds.\nMechanisms: Humoral immunity involves antibodies and B cells with T cell help. Cell-mediated immunity involves cytotoxic T cells.\nA clinical correlation is Reticular Dysgenesis, a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) that impacts both the innate (agranulocytosis) and adaptive (lymphopenia) immune systems, also causing sensorineural deafness. It is autosomal recessive and treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).\nEasy to understand explanation Think of your body's defense forces.

They also signal local cells to initiate repair and recruit specialized wound-healing cells to the damaged area.\nLymphocyte fate: Activating signals for B cells diminish, causing most plasma cells to die by apoptosis. However, some plasma cells migrate to the lymphatic system where they receive signals to survive for long periods, becoming memory cells ready for future exposures to the same organism. Pro-inflammatory T-helper cells undergo apoptosis, while anti-inflammatory T-helper cells become more active. Cytotoxic T cells also downregulate their activity.\nEasy to understand explanation Once the battle against an infection is over, your body begins a cleanup and repair phase.

They can kill directly or by sending out chemical signals.\nMacrophages: These are the \"big eaters\" that gobble up anything suspicious. They come in two flavors: M1, which are aggressive fighters, and M2, which are focused on cleaning up and repairing.

          "content": "Subtopic comprehensive notes Toll-like Receptors (TLRs) are a type of Pattern Recognition Receptor (PRR) that senses Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs). There are 10 functional TLR genes (TLR1-TLR10) in humans, plus a pseudogene for TLR11. When activated, TLRs signal macrophages and other cells to produce cytokines that interact with other immune cells. TLRs are found on most nucleated cells.\n\nThe TLR signaling cascade has increasing clinical relevance.\nTLR4 Signaling Example: Bacterial LPS binds TLR4, MD2, and CD14. MyD88 then binds the TIR domain of TLR4, and IRAK4 binds MyD88. This initiates a kinase cascade activating TRAF6 and inhibitor of kappa-B kinase (IKK). Most TLRs and the IL-1 receptor use this pathway.\nClinical Correlation (MyD88/IRAK4 Deficiency): Deficiency of IRAK4 or MyD88 causes human immunodeficiency, with common infections including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Gram-negative organisms. Those who survive usually don't have infections after age 14.\nIKK: A complex of three molecules: IKK-alpha, IKK-beta, and IKK-gamma (also known as NEMO).\nClinical Correlation (NEMO gene variants): Cause incontinentia pigmenti, anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, impaired antibody class switching (hyper-IgM phenotype), and recurrent infections.\nNF-kappa-B (NF\u03baB): IKK phosphorylates I-kappa-B, which releases NF-kappa-B.

External TLRs (like TLR2 and TLR4) mostly spot bacteria, while internal TLRs (like TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9) mostly spot viruses. When a TLR spots something, it triggers an alarm system inside the cell (a signaling cascade). A key part of this alarm involves MyD88, IRAK4, IKK, and finally, NF-kappa-B, which goes to the cell's \"control room\" (nucleus) to turn on genes for inflammatory messages.

NOD1 and NOD2 recognize PAMPs from internally digested pathogens. NLRP3 is a key NLR involved in inflammasome activation.\n\nThese diseases are mediated by the innate immune system, with IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-18, and TNF being major contributors. In contrast, autoimmune diseases are mediated by the adaptive immune system, driven by the IL-17 family and IFN-\u03b3.\nExamples of autoinflammatory diseases include Still disease, Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS), Muckle-Wells syndrome, Familial Mediterranean Fever, NOMID, TRAPS, Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, and CANDLE.\nClinical Correlation (FCAS1): An autosomal dominant condition caused by a gain-of-function gene variant in NLRP3. It presents with non-urticarial rash, fever, and arthralgias after cold exposure. It can be treated with IL-1\u03b2 inhibitors like canakinumab, rilonacept, or anakinra.\nEasy to understand explanation Inside your cells, there are sensors called NLRs. One important one, NLRP3, can form a \"danger complex\" called an inflammasome. When activated (like during infection), this inflammasome acts like a tiny bomb-making factory, producing a powerful inflammatory signal (IL-1\u03b2) and sometimes causing an explosive cell death called pyroptosis. If the NLRP3 sensor is faulty (e.g., a \"gain-of-function\" mutation), it can trigger too many bombs, leading to autoinflammatory diseases\u2014conditions where the innate immune system overreacts, causing constant, unprovoked inflammation, sometimes in response to a simple trigger like cold.\nMnemonic \"N.I.L. (NLR Inflammasome Lies)\" \u2013 NLRs (NLRP3) form Inflammasomes, producing Lots of IL-1\u03b2, leading to Lots of inflammation. For FCAS1: \"Cold NLRP3: R.A.F.T.!\" (Rash, Arthralgias, Fever, Treatment with IL-1 blockers).\n\nMacrophage activation induces the production of IL-1\u03b2 from its precursor, pro-IL-1\u03b2. IL-1\u03b2 is a potent pro-inflammatory molecule, so its production must be tightly regulated.\nCaspase 1 is the enzyme that converts pro-IL-1\u03b2 into active IL-1\u03b2. Its production from procaspase 1 increases upon macrophage activation, facilitated by the NLR cryopyrin, encoded by the NLRP3 gene.\nCryopyrin forms an inflammasome complex that binds procaspase 1. This leads to the proteolysis of procaspase 1 into active caspase 1, which then generates IL-1\u03b2.\nActivated inflammasomes can trigger pyroptosis (inflammatory cell death), which can contribute to cytokine storm and septic shock.\nClinical Correlation (COVID-19): Severe COVID-19 involves a systemic inflammatory response causing ARDS, partly due to dysregulated, intense NLRP3 activation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2.",

Gene variants in JAK or STAT components can also disrupt this pathway.\nClinical Syndrome: Defects in any component of the IL-12, IFN-gamma pathway cause \"Mendelian Susceptibility to Mycobacterial Disease\" (MSMD). Patients with MSMD develop infections with normally weakly-virulent mycobacteria, BCGosis, Salmonella, and sometimes TB.\nEasy to understand explanation This pathway is like an internal alarm system specifically for certain tough bacteria like mycobacteria. When TLR-2 detects these invaders, it triggers the release of IL-12. IL-12 then tells T cells and NK cells to produce a strong signal called IFN-gamma. IFN-gamma, in turn, super-activates macrophages to fight off the infection. Any breaks in this chain \u2013 from the IL-12 signal itself, to its receptor, to the IFN-gamma signal, or its receptor, or even the internal wiring (JAK-STAT) \u2013 can lead to severe susceptibility to these specific infections, known as MSMD.\nMnemonic \"TLR-2 to MSMD: I.I.N.S.\" (IL-12, IFN-\u03b3, NK cells/T cells, STAT/JAK) \"MSMD: My Stupid Macrophages Don't Respond!\" (MSMD occurs because macrophages can't get activated properly by IFN-\u03b3 due to pathway defects).\nOverview of the Adaptive Immune System_2025.pdf",

Their role is to eradicate infected or cancerous cells. Virus-infected cells typically express less MHC Class I on their surface, which can trigger NK cell activation. In the innate system, NK cells are activated by cytokines like Type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) and IL-12, secreted by infected cells. Once activated by IL-12, NK cells produce additional cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1. NK cells destroy target cells either indirectly through cytokine production (e.g., IFN-\u03b3) or directly by releasing cytolytic granules (containing perforin and granzymes) or inducing apoptosis via Fas-FasL interaction.\nMacrophages: Known as \"big eaters,\" they are indiscriminate phagocytes involved in both direct and indirect killing. Macrophage activation depends on cytokines like TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3. There are two types: M1 macrophages primarily promote pro-inflammatory responses, combating pathogens and signaling other immune cells.

Complement Functions:\nLysis: Punching holes in cell membranes. The terminal complement pathway (C5b, C6, C7, C8, C9) forms the membrane attack complex (MAC). Critical for defense against Neisseria gonorrheae and Neisseria meningitidis.

T cells, unlike B cells, need to be able to recognize certain self-antigens, but only with a specific, weak strength.\nThe testing process for proper development and self-specificity of both T cell and B cell receptors is complex, often described as \"education\".

The variable region of both chains contains hypervariable regions, also called complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), which are crucial for antigen specificity.\nThe T cell receptor alpha (\u03b1) chain is analogous to the B cell receptor light chain.\nThe T cell receptor beta (\u03b2) chain is analogous to the B cell receptor heavy chain.\nEasy to understand explanation T cell receptors (TCRs) look like one \"arm\" of an antibody. They have two main chains, usually called alpha (\u03b1) and beta (\u03b2), though a less common type uses gamma (\u03b3) and delta (\u03b4) chains. Each chain has a part that varies greatly (variable region) to recognize specific antigens, and a part that's pretty consistent (constant region). Just like antibodies, the most variable parts, called CDRs, are where the antigen actually binds. The alpha chain is like an antibody's light chain, and the beta chain is like its heavy chain.\nMnemonic \"TCR: A.B.C.D.!\" (Alpha, Beta, CDRs, Domains (variable/constant)). \"If you are a T cell, Always Bind Gamma Delta!\" (\u03b1\u03b2 TCRs are most common, \u03b3\u03b4 are a special population).\n\nImmature B cell: Assembles and expresses IgM molecules on its cell surface as a B cell receptor.\nMature (na\u00efve) B cell: Additionally assembles and expresses IgD molecules on its surface, as a second B cell receptor. IgM and IgD are the only two classes a B cell can make simultaneously.\nClass Switching: The process of switching to other antibody classes (IgA1-2, IgG1-4, IgE) occurs later during an immune response.\nEasy to understand explanation B cells start as basic stem cells in the bone marrow. To become proper B cells, they build their unique receptors through a complex DNA rearrangement. This process has \"quality control checks\": first, to make sure the receptor DNA is correctly formed, and second, to ensure the receptor doesn't mistakenly attack your own body. If a critical component like BTK (Bruton tyrosine kinase) is broken (as in XLA1), B cells can't pass these checks, fail to mature, and you end up with almost no functional antibodies, leading to frequent infections. Once mature, a B cell proudly displays two types of receptors: IgM and IgD. Only later, during an actual immune response, can it \"switch\" to making other types of antibodies like IgG or IgE.\nMnemonic \"B.B.Q.

The DNA for the constant regions is transcribed normally.\nV(D)J Recombination: This process creates the diverse variable regions of B and T cell receptors.\nLight chain V region (B cell) and \u03b1 chain V region (T cell): Genes have many V (variable) segments and a few J (joining) segments. One J segment randomly joins one V segment, forming VJ.\nHeavy chain V region (B cell) and \u03b2 chain V region (T cell): This involves an extra step. One D (diversity) segment first joins one J segment (forming DJ), and then DJ connects to one V segment, forming VDJ.\nJunctional Diversity: The DNA cutting, pasting, and repairing process is slightly \"sloppy,\" introducing \"junctional P and N nucleotides\" that significantly increase receptor diversity.\nRAG-1 and RAG-2 complexes: These oversee the V(D)J recombination process. Errors in pasting can cause cancer, highlighting the need for checkpoints.\nBRECs and TRECs: Unused, excised DNA forms loops called B cell receptor excision circles (BRECs) and T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) during B and T cell development.\nClinical Correlation (TREC Counting): Counting TRECs is part of newborn screening in all 50 US states. A low TREC count indicates problems with T cell development, a serious cause being severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).\nClinical Correlation (RAG-1 or RAG-2 deficiency): Gene variants causing loss of function in either RAG-1 or RAG-2 can lead to one form of SCID. Partial loss of function results in Omenn syndrome, sometimes called 'leaky SCID'. NK cells, lacking immune receptors, are unaffected.\nClinical Correlation (Burkitt\u2019s Lymphoma): Errors in DNA cutting and pasting can cause translocation of the MYC gene (chromosome 8) to the immunoglobulin heavy chain region (chromosome 14) or light chain chromosomes, leading to unregulated MYC expression and unchecked B cell growth (cancer).\n\nInitial Production: After VDJ recombination, a heavy chain gene is ready. VDJ is transcribed along with genetic material for both mu (\u03bc) and delta (\u03b4) heavy chains. The transcript is edited so that both IgM and IgD are produced as receptors on the surface of a mature B cell. In a primary immune response, IgM is the first circulating antibody class produced by plasma cells.\nSwitching: Different antibody classes have different functions. Under the direction of specific cytokines from the environment, the B cell may need to make one of the 4 IgG subclasses, 2 IgA subclasses, or IgE as its receptor. This involves the B cell associating VDJ with a different heavy chain gene \u2013 a process called class switching. DNA between VDJ and the new heavy chain gene gets looped out and is permanently lost. DNA distal to the switch remains available for further switching.\nHeavy Chain Sequence (Andy Thornton Method / Wayne Causey Method): IgM, IgD, IgG3, IgG1, IgA1, IgG2, IgG4, IgE, IgA2. When a switch occurs (e.g., from IgM/IgD to IgG1), IgM, IgD, and IgG3 are permanently lost from that B cell's potential repertoire, but other classes (IgA1, IgG2, IgG4, IgE, IgA2) remain available for subsequent switches.\nEasy to understand explanation Imagine your B and T cells have a huge library of gene segments (V, D, J, C). To make their unique receptors, they cut and paste these segments together in a random fashion (V(D)J recombination). This process, supervised by \"editor\" proteins like RAG-1 and RAG-2, also adds \"junk\" letters (P and N nucleotides) to increase diversity, ensuring each B or T cell has a slightly different receptor. After a B cell makes its receptor, it first produces IgM and IgD antibodies. But if the immune response needs a different \"tool\" (like IgG for long-term protection or IgE for allergies), the B cell can \"class switch.\" This means it cuts out and permanently discards the genes for IgM/IgD and replaces them with genes for the new antibody type, guided by chemical signals from other immune cells.\nMnemonic \"V.D.J.

Pre-formed antibodies can block this binding, preventing infection. IgG is effective in body tissues, while IgA is crucial on mucosal surfaces.\nToxin Neutralization: Bacterial and other toxins bind to target cell receptors, causing damage. High-affinity antibodies can bind to toxins, preventing their attachment to target cells. Again, IgG works in body tissues, and IgA on mucosal surfaces.\nBest Classes: IgG and IgA are best at neutralization.\nOpsonization: Simple antibody binding to pathogens or toxins doesn't eliminate them. Instead, antibodies \"tag\" them, identifying them for destruction by other immune cells. Neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages have Fc receptors that bind to the Fc portion of antibodies, allowing them to engulf and destroy the tagged targets through phagocytosis. These Fc receptors are antibody class-specific and named for the heavy chain they recognize (e.g., Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RII for IgG).\nBest Class: IgG (especially IgG1 and IgG3) is best for opsonization.\nADCC (Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity): Natural killer (NK) cells, which function in both innate and adaptive immune systems, have Fc receptors (Fc\u03b3RIII; CD16) that recognize antibodies coating an invader (opsonization). Crosslinking of these NK cell Fc receptors activates the NK cell, leading to the target cell's death via apoptosis.\nBest Classes: IgG1, IgG3 are best for ADCC.\nComplement Activation: The complement system performs many functions, including opsonization, promoting inflammation, phagocytosis, and scavenging unwanted circulating immune complexes.\nClinical Correlation (Immune Complexes and SLE): In Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), massive immune complex formation is a major cause of renal failure. Deficiencies in early complement components can lead to lupus-like diseases because immune complexes cannot be properly tagged with C4b or C3b for clearance.\nBest Classes: IgM and IgG (but not IgG4) are best for complement activation.\nIgE and Mast Cells: Mast cells, basophils, and activated eosinophils express Fc\u03b5RI, a high-affinity IgE receptor. When crosslinked by antigen (allergen), this receptor causes mast cell activation. Activated mast cells release histamine, leukotrienes, cytokines, and other mediators, which produce immediate allergic symptoms, recruit eosinophils, and amplify IgE responses. Mast cell mediators are also important in defense against certain parasites.\nClinical Correlation (Tryptase): Elevated serum tryptase levels are a biomarker for mast cell activation (e.g., anaphylaxis, mastocytosis). BTK is an important signaling molecule in mast cell activation, and BTK inhibitors are in trials for conditions like non-allergic urticaria and mastocytosis.\nBest Class: IgE is best for sensitizing mast cells and basophils.\nEasy to understand explanation Antibodies are like specialized tools your body uses to fight off threats. Here are their main jobs:\nNeutralization: Like putting a \"do not enter\" sign on invaders or toxins, stopping them from binding to your cells and causing harm. IgG works in your body, IgA protects surfaces.\nOpsonization: Like \"tagging\" an enemy with a sticky note, making it easier for your \"clean-up crew\" (macrophages) to spot, grab, and eat. IgG is particularly good at this.\nADCC: Like flagging an enemy for an \"assassin\" cell (NK cell). The antibody marks the target, and the NK cell comes along, recognizes the flag, and kills the marked cell. IgG helps here.\nComplement Activation: Like setting off a cascade of alarms that bring in more fighters, helps tag enemies, promotes inflammation, and cleans up debris. IgM and IgG are good at triggering this.\nIgE and Mast Cells: Like triggering an \"allergic reaction bomb.\" IgE antibodies bind to mast cells, and when they encounter an allergen, the mast cells explode, releasing chemicals that cause immediate allergic symptoms (and also help fight parasites).\nMnemonic \"N.O.C.A.C.\": Neutralization, Opsonization, Complement activation, ADCC, Cell sensitization (IgE/Mast cells).",
